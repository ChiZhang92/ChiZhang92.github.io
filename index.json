We implement the proposed PVI extractor on both sequential approaches (long short-term memory (LSTM) models) and non-sequential approaches (convolutional models). We use the Waymo Open Dataset that contains real-world urban traffic scenes with both pedestrian and vehicle annotations. For the LSTM-based models, our proposed model is compared with Social-LSTM and Social-GAN, and using our proposed PVI extractor reduces the average displacement error (ADE) and the final displacement error (FDE) by 7.46% and 5.24%, respectively. For the convolutional-based models, our proposed model is compared with Social-STGCNN and Social-IWSTCNN, and using our proposed PVI extractor reduces the ADE and FDE by 2.10% and 1.27%, respectively. The results show that the pedestrian-vehicle interaction influences pedestrian behavior, and the models using the proposed PVI extractor can capture the interaction between pedestrians and vehicles, and thereby outperform the compared methods.","tags":[],"title":"Learning the Pedestrian-Vehicle Interaction for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chi Zhang","Christian Berger"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

This task is challenging because the behavior of pedestrians is influenced by both their own history paths and the interactions with others. Previous research modeled these interactions with pooling mechanisms or aggregating with hand-crafted attention weights. In this paper, we present the Social Interaction-Weighted Spatio- Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (Social-IWSTCNN), which includes both the spatial and the temporal features. We propose a novel design, namely the Social Interaction Extractor, to learn the spatial and social interaction features of pedestrians. Most previous works used ETH and UCY datasets which include five scenes but do not cover urban traffic scenarios extensively for training and evaluation. In this paper, we use the recently released large-scale Waymo Open Dataset in urban traffic scenarios, which includes 374 urban training scenes and 76 urban testing scenes to analyze the performance of our proposed algorithm in comparison to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. The results show that our algorithm outperforms SOTA algorithms such as Social-LSTM, Social-GAN, and Social-STGCNN on both Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE). Furthermore, our Social- IWSTCNN is 54.8 times faster in data pre-processing speed, and 4.7 times faster in total test speed than the current best SOTA algorithm Social-STGCNN.","tags":[],"title":"Social-IWSTCNN: A Social Interaction-Weighted Spatio- Temporal Convolutional Neural Network for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction in Urban Traffic Scenarios","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chi Zhang","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
